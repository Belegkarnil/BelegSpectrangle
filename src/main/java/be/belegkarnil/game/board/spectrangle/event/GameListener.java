/**
 * The listener interface for receiving "interesting" game events (begin, and end) during a game.
 * The class that is interested in processing a game event either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract {@link GameAdapter} class (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * <p>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered in a {@link be.belegkarnil.game.board.spectrangle.strategy.Strategy}'s {@link be.belegkarnil.game.board.spectrangle.strategy.Strategy#register(Game)} on the {@link Game} object using {@link Game#addGameListener(GameListener)}.
 * Please, do not forget to unregister the listener when the {@link be.belegkarnil.game.board.spectrangle.strategy.Strategy}'s {@link be.belegkarnil.game.board.spectrangle.strategy.Strategy#unregister(Game)} method is called by using {@link Game#removeGameListener(GameListener)} on the {@link Game} object.
 * A game event is generated when a game starts or ends. When a game event occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the {@link GameEvent} is passed to it.
